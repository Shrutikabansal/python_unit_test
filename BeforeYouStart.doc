Firstly install pytest :
# pip install pytest
Always start with “test_” all the test cases
After writing the test file you have to execute the file 
# python -m pytest
It’ll execute all the test file in the sub directories too
Use -v command for see the detailed information


Suppose now you want to skip one test case for the moment then what  you can do is just skip using this just before the function

@pytest.mark.skip(reason=” ”)
and  to see what the reason to skip that function we use command
# pytest -v -rxs
